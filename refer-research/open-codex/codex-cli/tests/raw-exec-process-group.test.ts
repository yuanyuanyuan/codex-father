// Regression test: When cancelling an in‑flight `rawExec()` the implementation
// must terminate *all* processes that belong to the spawned command – not just
// the direct child.  The original logic only sent `SIGTERM` to the immediate
// child which meant that grandchildren (for instance when running through a
// `bash -c` wrapper) were left running and turned into "zombie" processes.
// Strategy:
//   1. Start a Bash shell that spawns a long‑running `sleep`, prints the PID
//      of that `sleep`, and then waits forever.  This guarantees we can later
//      check if the grand‑child is still alive.
//   2. Abort the exec almost immediately.
//   3. After `rawExec()` resolves we probe the previously printed PID with
//      `process.kill(pid, 0)`.  If the call throws `ESRCH` the process no
//      longer exists – the desired outcome.  Otherwise the test fails.
// The negative‑PID process‑group trick employed by the fixed implementation is
// POSIX‑only.  On Windows we skip the test.
