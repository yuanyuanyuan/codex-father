# Tasks: PRD Draft Documentation System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-docs-prd-draft/` **Prerequisites**:
plan.md ✅, research.md ✅, data-model.md ✅, contracts/ ✅, quickstart.md ✅

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ Found: TypeScript 5.x + Node.js 18+, Markdown parser, Mermaid, file system
2. Load optional design documents:
   → ✅ data-model.md: 7 entities → 7 model tasks
   → ✅ contracts/: 2 files → 2 contract test tasks
   → ✅ research.md: Technical decisions → setup tasks
   → ✅ quickstart.md: 5 test scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting (3 tasks)
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests (7 tasks)
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands (17 tasks)
   → Integration: file system, permissions, rendering (8 tasks)
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs (15 tasks)
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T050)
6. Generate dependency graph ✅
7. Create parallel execution examples ✅
8. Validate task completeness:
   → ✅ All contracts have tests
   → ✅ All entities have models
   → ✅ All endpoints implemented
9. Return: SUCCESS (50 tasks ready for execution)
```
