# Feature Specification: PRD Draft Documentation System

**Feature Branch**: `002-docs-prd-draft` **Created**: 2025-09-28 **Status**:
Draft **Input**: User description: "docs/prd-draft.md"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí PRD draft documentation system requested
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: product managers, stakeholders, developers
   ‚Üí Actions: create, edit, review, maintain PRD drafts
   ‚Üí Data: PRD documents, templates, versions
   ‚Üí Constraints: draft state management, collaboration workflow
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ PRD template format: Markdown with technical architecture fields and hierarchical structure
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Collaborative workflow: Architect-led with team feedback (no real-time collaboration)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Approval process: Simple review involving product managers, dev teams, and test teams
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Create and manage PRD drafts
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on PRD draft lifecycle
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí PRD documents, templates, versions, review status
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ All requirements clarified and testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning phase)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a product manager, I want to create and maintain PRD (Product Requirements
Document) drafts so that I can iteratively develop clear product specifications
before final approval and implementation planning.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** no existing PRD draft, **When** user initiates PRD creation,
   **Then** system provides structured template for draft creation
2. **Given** an existing PRD draft, **When** user makes edits, **Then** system
   preserves edit history and maintains draft status
3. **Given** a completed PRD draft, **When** user requests review, **Then**
   system enables review workflow and status tracking
4. **Given** multiple PRD drafts, **When** user needs to find specific draft,
   **Then** system provides search and organization capabilities

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a PRD draft becomes orphaned or abandoned?
- How does the system handle conflicting edits in collaborative scenarios?
- What occurs when a draft needs to be reverted to previous version?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new PRD drafts using predefined
  templates
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable editing and updating of existing PRD drafts
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain version history and change tracking for each
  draft
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide draft status management (draft, under review,
  approved, etc.)
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable organization and categorization of multiple PRD
  drafts
- **FR-006**: System MUST support architect-led editing workflow with team
  feedback and review capabilities
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide simple review workflow involving product
  managers, development teams, and testing teams
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement role-based access control (architect: full
  edit, product manager: business sections edit, dev/test teams: read+comment)
- **FR-009**: System MUST support fixed template structure with customizable
  section ordering and decision comparison tables
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with Mermaid diagram rendering and ASCII
  text drawing tools for technical documentation
- **FR-011**: System MUST support Markdown format with code blocks, technical
  charts, and structured elements (section numbering, cross-references)
- **FR-012**: System MUST enable tracking of technical decision comparisons and
  rationale documentation
- **FR-013**: System MUST support hierarchical document structure (overview ‚Üí
  implementation ‚Üí features ‚Üí MVP)
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide optional import functionality from existing
  documentation formats
- **FR-015**: System MUST maintain version history without complex branching or
  real-time collaborative editing

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **PRD Draft**: Represents a product requirements document in draft state,
  contains hierarchical sections (overview, implementation details, features,
  MVP), supports Markdown format with code blocks and technical diagrams
- **Template**: Fixed structure for creating new PRD drafts with technical
  architecture fields (protocols, engines, backend modes), allows section
  reordering and custom decision comparison tables
- **Version**: Historical snapshot of PRD draft changes without complex
  branching, enables simple tracking and history review
- **Review Status**: Current state of draft in workflow (draft, under review,
  confirmed), managed through simple architect-led process
- **User Role**: Defines access levels (Architect: full edit, Product Manager:
  business section edit, Dev/Test teams: read+comment)
- **Technical Decision**: Documented comparison of technical approaches with
  rationale, supports decision tracking throughout draft lifecycle
- **Diagram Component**: Embedded visual elements using Mermaid or ASCII text
  drawing for architecture visualization
